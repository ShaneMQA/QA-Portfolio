# User & Orders API – QA Testing Project

## Overview
This project focuses on testing a simulated REST API for user authentication and order management. The goal was to validate API responses, status codes, request/response structures, and error handling using manual API testing techniques.

## Scope
Endpoints tested (simulated):
- `POST /login` – user authentication
- `GET /users/{id}` – fetch user profile
- `GET /orders` – list all orders for a user
- `POST /orders` – create a new order
- `GET /orders/{id}` – get a specific order
- `DELETE /orders/{id}` – delete an existing order

## Responsibilities
- Designed API test cases based on requirements and endpoint behavior
- Executed manual tests using a REST client (e.g., Postman)
- Validated HTTP status codes, response bodies (JSON), and error messages
- Performed positive and negative testing with valid and invalid payloads
- Documented API defects with clear reproduction steps and expected vs actual results

## Skills Demonstrated
- API Testing (REST)
- HTTP methods (GET, POST, DELETE)
- Status code validation (200, 400, 401, 404, 500)
- JSON response validation
- Positive & negative testing
- Bug reporting and documentation
