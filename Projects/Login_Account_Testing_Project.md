- Executed positive and negative tests (valid and invalid data)
- Verified error messages, field validation, and lockout rules
- Logged defects with severity, repro steps, expected vs actual results
- Retested fixed scenarios and performed basic regression checks

## Skills Demonstrated
- Functional Testing
- Negative Testing
- Validation Testing
- Test Case Design
- Bug Reporting
- Requirements Analysis
- Attention to Detail
